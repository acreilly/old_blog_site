<h3>Week Four Cultural Blog</h3>
<h5>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h5>
<p>I was bartending, talking with a customer about their order and a server interrupts us about a ticket. He did this quite often and at this point it was just plain rude and disrespectful to the customer. I tell him that he needs to stop interrupting like that because it is disrespectful to the customer and to be a little more patient. He snapped back at me with a rude comment about me taking forever and some nasty words following.</p>
<h5>What was the source of the conflict?</h5>
<p>I believe he was stressed out so instead of acting appropriately he lashed out which resulted in me lashing out.</p>
<h5>How did you handle that conflict?</h5>
<p>I told him that if he acts that way, I will just take longer to get him his drinks. I did so in some sense because what he said was very irritating and rude.</p>
<h5>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h5>
<p>My actions weren't mature or appropriate, but he stopped interrupting and being impatient so it benefited me.</p>
<h5>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h5>
</p>I mean, what I did wasn't exactly appropriate, but his response to me politely saying that it is disrespectful to interrupt the customer and needs to be more patient was completely inappropriate and unnecessary. I guess I would have maybe not purposely took forever with the drinks, but because I did he stopped his negative actions.</p>
<h5>What did you learn from this experience?</h5>
<p>Stress makes people do things they normally wouldn't if calm. Also that I desperately need to get out of the restaurant business. </p>
