			<h3>Week Eight Cultural Blog</h3>
			<h5>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges? Was something particularly fun or rewarding? Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</h5>
<p>At first, I didn't like it. That was because we were working on HTML and CSS and I feel confident, maybe too confident, in my abilities. It made it difficult to work with others since I didn't feel like it was benefiting me. Once I started on other types of challenges, like Ruby and Javascript, working with others was great. I have a decent understanding for the basics, but it is a learning experience working with others and helps broaden your way of thinking out the problem. Plus, I got to work with people who are intelligent with similar interests as me which is very enjoyable.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<h5>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</h5>
<p>Well, my first few reviews made me feel upset with myself. I tend to be controlling and will take over if I feel confident in the challenge. I a couple pieces of feedback where people basically stated that in a kind way. I have been working on it though, and the rest of my feedback has been very positive.</p>
<h5>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</h5>
<p>Yes, it helps me know what I need to work on and what I am doing right. If the feedback is positive, it makes me feel good.</p>
<h5>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</h5>
<p>Well, my feedback has been pretty positive, I have been working with others sharing roles of driving and navigating. I think all I need to do is continue to remember to work equally with others and not take over.</p>
<h5>How was it to write feedback?</h5>
<p>It was good, I hope I was specific enough. Mostly everyone I have worked with has been great so there is nothing negative to state.</p>
<h5>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</h5>
<p>The first feedback I had to write, I felt like the person didn't work well with me and didn't put any input, even when I asked for it. It was tough figuring out how to write how I felt without sounding harsh.</p>
<h5>Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</h5>
<p>I think its great. I enjoy pairing, it is a great learning experience. I need to work on writing feedback more detailed, but I have found the feedback I have received to be very helpful.</p>
