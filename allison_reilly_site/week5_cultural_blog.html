<h3>Week Five Cultural Blog</h3>
<p>I literally googled, problems facing the tech world and the first page of google had a ton of information of the inequality and mistreatment of women. I had known that women were not common in the tech work force, I even found it amusing that Dev Bootcamp gave a discount to veterans.. people who risk their lives for their country.. and women. I've never seen that before, but of course I just say, okay, Ill take the discount. Now that I am researching the topic, it is actually a larger issue than I thought. Not only their aren't enough women in technology careers, they are also treated poorly sometimes just because of gender.</p>
<p>Women hold only a quarter of all information technology jobs and around 50% of women in science, engineering, and technology jobs quit and often do something completely different with their career. The article Technology's Mans Problem states, "Many women who want to be engineers encounter a field where they not only are significantly underrepresented but also feel pushed away." Women in the field say that the culprit of feeling this way is the sexist, alpha-male culture that makes women feel unwelcome, demeaned, and even endangered.</p>
<p>Tech start-ups are often a more desirable place to work, but the number of women in these companies is much lower, an average of 12%, due to the fact that sexist problems tend to go unnoticed due to lack of structure. At start-ups, the lines between work and social life are often blurry because people tend to be young, work long hours, and the founders and first employees are often friends. Start-ups tend to pride themselves on a lack of bureaucracy, they are lacking big-company layers like human resources departments. They believe they can move faster that way, without becoming bogged down in protocol.</p>
<p><em>“In engineering, whoever owns the code, they have the power,” said Ana Redmond, a software engineer. When she worked as a senior engineer at a big company, Expedia, she said she was constantly underestimated by male colleagues and suffered because she was not willing to leave her children to work the hours needed to “own the code.”</em></p>
<p>I found this interesting because usually a bunch of engineers work together to build code or a whole project. That seems a bit controlling to say, " I own the code because I spent the most hours on it." You could have been writing a bunch of bullshit, I mean, if you really need to say someone owns the code, shouldn't it be the person who had the most beneficial part of the code?</p>
<p><em>"Women often take on the role of product manager, or P.M., which entails the so-called soft skills of managing people and bridging the business and engineering divide. Yet even though this is an essential job, it’s the purely technical people — not the businesspeople — who get the respect in the tech industry."</em></p>
<p>I find this interesting, because I was t alking with a man who co-founded his own successful start up, and he told me that women were sought out in the tech field because of their communication skills and often are hired to work with the clients directly. This is an example of what the article stated above.</p>
<p>These problems in the tech world do concern me a bit, I wouldn't want to be treated differently because of my gender. Luckily, (maybe not?) people often tell me I'm not much of a girl, and I agree with that. I look like one and dress like one, but I definitely act like a guy. From the article, The Loneliness of the Female Coder, <em>"I once worked on a project with a former soldier who had served in Iraq and a female member of my team. The ex-soldier told us that he had never heard such shocking language in the army as came out of her mouth (Hi Hilary!). A joke which would jar more sensitive types, the potty-mouthed Hilary would find hilarious."</em> Hilary seems to sound like me. The write also states though, <em>"On the other hand, I have often been in situations where an off-color joke or careless comment made me feel extremely uncomfortable. We understand that sometimes it’s hard to know what’s appropriate."</em> I'm really not offended by much, but if I am, I will definitely tell you. I won't hate you or make you feel bad, but I will say thats fucked up or make a rude remark back destroying your manhood. I.. should probably work on that. I guess I wouldn't do that for the sake of my job.</p>
<p>Although these articles had a lot of interesting insight, I am not going to go into a career with the mind set that I will be treated differently, because if you think that way, you are more likely to make it become reality.</p>
