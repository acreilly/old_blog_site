	<h3>Nettus</h3>
	<p>This website has amazing tutorials. I love how a lot of the tutorials are in a video form, so I can watch what the teacher does and work along. This website is also easy to navigate. There are different sites for different purposes. Web design, photoshop, ect. Then there are categories in the nav to narrow your search. You can also just type in the seach bar what you are looking for.</p>
