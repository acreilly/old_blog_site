<h3>Blog Post #5</h3>
<h5>What's your take on the DBC experience?</h5>
<p>It is a beneficial program that will help set you up with the skills needed for a career in the development field.</p>
<h5>What is your impression of DBC?</h5>
<p>It is a quality program that teaching its students everything you need to be an entry level ruby developer. DBC is well known and has had many success stories. I chose DBC because it was the first of its kind and also the highest rated program.</p>
<h5>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h5>
<p>I believe I have the skills and qualities to become a successful developer. I think this program will benefit me greatly. I enjoy how DBC teaches you to work with others because that is exactly what people will have to do in real world experiences.</p>
<h5>Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?</h5>
<p>Not at all, I think it will be a great program for me and I expect it to benefit me.</p>
<h5>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h5>
<p>I am excited, but a bit nervous only because when it comes to coding I have always worked on my own and I tend to be, or at least believe, I am self sufficient and I like to do things on my own.</p>
