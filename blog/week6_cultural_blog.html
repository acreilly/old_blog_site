			<h3>Week Six Cultural Blog</h3>
			<p>Stereotype threat is the risk of confirming oneself negative stereotype about ones group. In 1995, the term was first used by Steele and Aronson who had created several experiments displaying stereotype threat among minorities. Over 300 experiments on stereotype threat have been published in peer-reviewed journals.</p>
			<br>
			<p>There are more consequences for stereotype threat than underachievement in academics, like reducing a sense of belonging or it can lead to self-handicapping strategies. Stereotype threat has been shown to affect stereotyped individuals’ performance in a number of domains beyond academics, such as white men in sports, women in negotiation, homosexual men in providing childcare, and women in driving.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Honestly, I don't feel like I have dealt with stereotype threat personally. I am a blonde white woman who doesn't let others opinions change me. I've been told I'm stupid because I am blonde, I've had people make jokes about women and cooking or driving ect, but I have never allowed them to change me. I'm smart, I'm a good driver.. I speed but I do that on purpose and have full control while doing so, and yeah I cook, but I enjoy cooking for my fiancé. Jokes about me being dumb can hurt, but I don't believe them nor allow them to change me to fail.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I'm a very friendly person and hang out with everyone, doesn't matter what race, age, or gender. I am the one who invites someone over to sit with my group if they are sitting by themselves. I put in effort to get to know people. Thats just how I am, but that will make people feel more comfortable and less likely to feel stereotype threat.</p>
